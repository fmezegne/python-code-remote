# erocount down backward from ten to zero using while loop


n = 10   # here i define the number of count
print("\n STARTING TO COUNTDOWN BACKWARD FROM 10 TO O \n")   # then i will print the statement so anybody reading my code will know what i am about to do
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1     # this is the same as n = n-1
print("\n THE COUNTDOWN IS OVER \n")
